🤔 **Question:** What is the internal structure of Java objects?

💡 **Answer:** Java objects contain metadata such as a class pointer, flags, a lock, and size information. 

- 🏫 The class pointer is a pointer to the class information of the object, which includes its name, superclass, fields, methods, and other metadata. 
- 🚩 Flags store various information about the object, such as whether it has been finalized or marked as "synchronized" for concurrent access control. 
- 🔒 The lock is used to control concurrent access

🤯  **_Explaination:_**

🏫 **Class pointer:** A Java object contains a pointer to its class information. This information includes the name of the class, its superclass, its fields, methods, and other metadata. The class pointer is used by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to determine the type of the object at runtime and to perform dynamic dispatch of methods.

🚩 **Flags:** Flags are used to store various information about the object. For example, an object may have a flag indicating whether it has been finalized by the garbage collector or not. Other flags may indicate whether the object is an array or not, whether it is immutable, or whether it has been marked as a "synchronized" object for concurrent access control.

🔒 **Lock:** The lock variable or pointer to a monitor object is used to control concurrent access to the object. In Java, objects can be marked as "synchronized" to prevent multiple threads from accessing the object at the same time. When a thread tries to access a synchronized object, it must first acquire the lock associated with the object. The lock ensures that only one thread can access the object at a time.

📏 **Size:** The size of the object is the amount of memory required to store the object. For objects that are not arrays, the size is determined by the sum of the sizes of the object's fields plus the size of the object's metadata. For array-type objects, the size is determined by the length of the array and the size of each element in the array.
