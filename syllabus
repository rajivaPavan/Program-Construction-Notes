# Syllabus Outline

## 1. Engineering aspects of program construction [4 hrs] 🛠️
The requirement for program construction satisfying non-functional requirements of higher processing performance, improved memory efficiency, modularity to support diversity of interfaces, runtime reliability through improved exception handling, and support for real-time and embedded applications through asynchronous event handling and synchronized execution of threads.


## 2. Object-oriented programming [6 hrs] 🧬
The design of programs based on the object-oriented programming paradigm and the concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding for objects, hierarchy of objects and inheritance, composite objects through composition and object relations of association and aggregation, and polymorphism.


## 3. Use of strong typing in programming [2 hrs] 💪
The construction of programs using Java as a strongly-typed language with underlying run-time system support for exception handling and memory management with comparisons to C as a weakly-typed language.


## 4. State machine representation [8 hrs] 💻
Design of a program as state machines with object representation of states and transitions supported by design patterns.


## 5. Reusable program coding [8 hrs] 🔄
The construction of non-trivial programs using Java class libraries for streams, exceptions, threads, observers, listeners, and templates.
